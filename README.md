# NHSA Dashboard

The National Head Start Association (NHSA) is a non-profit organization in the United States that advocates for and supports the Head Start program. Program directors need data about their communities, ranging from information about potentially eligible families, area labor market conditions affect labor supply and teacher retention, housing and transportation issues that could affect attendance, as well as characteristics about the environment, such as tree cover and air quality. This project indexes data sources and proposes methods to make the data accessible to Head Start program managers.
